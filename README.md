# TMI-2015

Code to generate figures from the paper "Optimizing flip angles for metabolic 
rate estimation in hyperpolarized carbon-13 MRI" 
by John Maidens, Jeremy Gordon, Murat Arcak, and Peder Larson. 

To generate figures, please ensure that the following MATLAB toolboxes are installed and included on your path: 
* Optimization Toolbox
* Symbolic Math Toolbox. 

The code is divided into two folders, each containing a script MAIN.m that can be run to generate the figures. 

This code has been tested using MATLAB version R2014b (8.4.0.150421) for 64-bit mac with Symbolic 
Math Toolbox Version 6.1 and Optimization Toolbox Version 7.1.
